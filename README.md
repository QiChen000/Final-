# Final
Project Concept

In the pandemic era, the Chinese government has over-prevented and controlled the epidemic by blocking off epidemic-intensive neighbourhoods with iron gates, closing down dine-in restaurants and preventing access to public places without daily nucleic acid certificates. These perverse regulations have seriously affected people's regular lives and caused public discontent with society. And one of the public's online voices has been restricted by the Chinese media.

This project is a record of the chaotic and contradictory ideology of Chinese society at this time, graphically representing the state apparatus's coercive means overlaid with the people's spontaneous cries to express a public sentiment that will hopefully lead to social reflection and resonance among the people.

This work uses squares to represent the deleted text, and the effect of typing a wireless loop indicates that there are people who have been speaking out and the problem has not been solved. In the background, the rotating squares are controlled by the mouse with intense rhythmic music, expressing the anger and tense atmosphere with every move the government makes. The human voice in English is no nucleic acid, no health code. Instead of giving us protection against the epidemic, these regulations have become a shackle on people's lives. Eventually, the repressed people shouted the words out. The voice creates a stark social conflict with articles that cannot be seen.
